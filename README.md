# Hi, I'm Clesuka! 👋

🎮 **Game Developer | Front-End Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm the founder of Holic Games Studio, an indie game studio based in Pontianak, West Borneo. Our small team consists of three people, and in addition to game development, we also create software and web applications.

I have been passionate about games since middle school, and I initially formed a development team called RPG Holic Studio, which later became Holic Games Studio. I graduated with a Diploma in Information Technology Engineering from Politeknik Negeri Pontianak in 2024. Our team has been recognized as a finalist in the KMIPN V and VI competitions for the Game Development Category.
